-----------------------------

**This semester I participated in a digital humanities project.** I

also grew plants in a garden.  


**At the semester’s end,** I was charged with producing a poster

about the food system of the U.S., as well as this blog post.

Because my poster vaguely implicated the plants that I had grown

in the garden, I photographed them with my telephone, emailed

them to myself from the telephone, manipulated their resolution

so as to ensure life-like representations, and placed them on my

poster. That is, I transferred the digital files that made up

the pictures of my plants to the poster. Now I find myself

wondering: are those actually my plants? 


**I suggest two secondary questions with that first question.** One:

is a plant experienced as a picture of a plant still a plant?

And, on a related note, two: is our understanding of a plant

predicated on its ability to grow, or to change? The techno-

theorist Lisa Gitelman can help us think about these points.  



**In a chapter entitled** “Near Print and Beyond Paper: Knowing by

*.pdf”, Gitelman discusses the manner in which PDF format

documents are in fact digital imitations of physical papers. On

page 114, she writes, “This chapter tackles a related instance:

not illustrations that conjure visual media, but rather

documents that may be said to conjure themselves. I am

interested particularly in cases where the self-evidence or

facticity of modern texts becomes variously if often

surreptitiously self-conscious, _when documents are experienced_

_as pictures of themselves_” (emphasis added). An obvious

difference exists between plants and documents here: where

documents are reproduced digitally only to be consumed in the

same manner as their physical counterparts, plants live in the

digital not to be consumed (eaten), but to be seen. But I

believe the point is still relevant. A picture of a plant is not

actually a plant. What type of perception, then, does its

pictorial portrayal contribute to? Does seeing a plant as

digital object negate its material being?  



**If we return to our PDF analogy,** Gitelman might have some

answers. She continues on page 115, “Viewed within a PDF-reader

application, they [PDFs] are emphatically not ‘living’

documents... They aren’t ongoing or ‘evergreen’: like print

artifacts, they are open for reading but closed for any in-text,

in-kind revision.” Gitelman argues here that early PDF formats

disallowed editing on the part of the reader, which likened them

to the physical documents they sought to replicate. They were

not “living” or “evergreen” in the sense that they could not

mature, which is reasonable enough when one considers a document

(is it the inherent nature of a document to mature?), but less

so when one comes to a plant. The very essence of a plant is

bound up in its connection to change: it sprouts, develops,

rots. Or we ingest it, transform it into energy, and, in one

form or another, it re-nourishes the soil that sustained its

growth. What is achieved by narrowing that process to a single

image?  



**Here is the question I really want to answer:** what is the ethic

of plant-growing if the plants are reproduced in an arena in

which they cannot be living entities? Is the work of dis-

alienation from “nature”, “food”, “plants” undone by a digital

portrayal which necessarily alienates space from plant? For the

sake of indispensable optimism, and in an attempt to welcome the

integration of “computerized” and whatever the world outside of

the computer is, I say no. Sure, the pictures do not correspond

to my plants’ physical reality anymore. But at a not-too-distant

point in the past, those _were_ actually my plants. As Gitelman

says, “intersecting imaginaries” define comprehension of the

plant picture as digital medium (118). While the picture of

plant acts on the viewer, the viewer acts equally on it,

imagining, I can only hope, soil, sun, rain, and the cycle of

which everything (even the digital) is a part.
