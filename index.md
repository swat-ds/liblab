Now in its tenth year, the LibLab Fellows program is an experiment in library-based learning guided by a critical consideration of just what we mean by "the digital." Fellows engage theory and practice of digital scholarship through open lab hours and weekly discussion meetings during the fall semester and spring semester


## Week 1 - September 11: Introductions, Framing & The Infrastructure of the Internet


An introduction to the terrain + the internet and its modalities. This week, we introduce the fellowship and begin by looking at what do we mean when we say *internet*? What makes it different from other forms of information technology and where can we find it? The internet, the idea and its physical infrastructure, permeates every hour of our days. Understanding its history and the metaphors we use to give shape to it, become a daily endevor, so as to continue to have a critical eye towards it.

Reflection: As we move from the physical to the digital. What new information is gained? What is lost? Is this even a helpful dynamic?

## Week 7 - October 30: Language of Visualization + Open refine

[![Bertin, Semiology of Graphics. 1983. p. 43.](media/bertin.png)](https://www.historyofinformation.com/detail.php?id=3361)

Can we move beyond pleasing images representing data to and understand that visualizations are a language in themselves? In other words, rather than just understanding visualizations as representations of data can we understand them as data?

In this process, what do we gain access to and, oppositely, what is effaced or made invisible?
