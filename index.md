Now in its fifth year, the LibLab Fellows program is an experiment in library-based learning guided by a critical consideration of just what we mean by "the digital." Fellows engage theory and practice of digital scholarship through open lab hours and weekly discussion meetings during the fall semester.

We will be making use of the data visualization platform [Observable](https://observablehq.com), working on what might be called the ["Computational Essays"](https://observablehq.com/@bulbil/computational-essay) during the course of the semester. [You can explore some of past work along with notebooks that inspired us here.](https://observablehq.com/collection/@bulbil/lib-lab-2019)
