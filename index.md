Now in its fourth year, the LibLab Fellows program is an experiment in library-based learning guided by a critical consideration of just what we mean by "the digital." Fellows engage theory and practice of digital scholarship through open lab hours and weekly discussion meetings during the fall semester.

In 2019, both our discussion and code were facilitated by [Observable](https://observablehq.com), including ["Computational Essays"](https://observablehq.com/@bulbil/computational-essay) that fellows worked on during the course of the semester. [You can explore some of our work along with notebooks that inspired us here.](https://observablehq.com/collection/@bulbil/lib-lab-2019)
