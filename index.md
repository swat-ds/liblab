Now in its fifth year, the LibLab Fellows program is an experiment in library-based learning guided by a critical consideration of just what we mean by "the digital." Fellows engage theory and practice of digital scholarship through open lab hours and weekly discussion meetings during the fall semester.

We will be making use of the data visualization platform [Observable](https://observablehq.com), working on what might be called the ["Computational Essays"](https://observablehq.com/@bulbil/computational-essay) during the course of the semester. [You can explore some of past work along with notebooks that inspired us here.](https://observablehq.com/collection/@bulbil/lib-lab-2019)

## Week 3: Considering Infrastructure

![National ARPA Network Map](media/arpa-network.jpg)

Before we can go further into networked technologies, we ought to have a starting point -- What do we mean when we say *internet*?

- [Abbate, Janet. "Government, Business, and the Making of the Internet." *The Business History Review* (Spring 2001):147-149, 157-176](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2224126/liblab/items/CE7JGUQ9/file)
- [Visions for the Future Internet](https://findingctrl.nesta.org.uk/) A collection of essays, short stories, poetry and art work reflecting on the question of *what is the internet* and its history. As you browse the site focus on one section (Timeline, Enter, Power, Shift, Delete, ALT, Escape) that most interests you. Come prepared to share your thoughts and opinions

## Week 4: Getting used to Observable + Intro to Data

*No readings this week.* We will spend our time getting to know Observable and some of its quirks. Also, since our projects require us to get our hands dirty with data, we will chat about how we use data in our daily life and what we will need to consider to choose a dataset for our project.  

To that end, Lisa Gitelman and Virginia Jackson write in the introduction for *'Raw Data'Is an Oxymoron*, 
>"Data need to be imagined as data to exist and function as such, and the imagination of data entails an interpretive base."

*For next week:*  
- What do the authors mean when they write that "data need to be imagined"?
- Find an Observalble notebook that is data-driven and appeals to you. You can always begin in the [explore](https://observablehq.com/explore) section of Observablehq.com but feel free to look elsewhere.
