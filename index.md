Now in its eigth, the LibLab Fellows program is an experiment in library-based learning guided by a critical consideration of just what we mean by "the digital." Fellows engage theory and practice of digital scholarship through open lab hours and weekly discussion meetings during the fall semester and spring semester


## Week 1 - September 14: Introductions and framing

An introduction to the terrain.

From the physical to the digital. What new information is gained? What is lost? 

Readings:
- [‘Farewell, Etaoin Shrdlu'](https://www.nytimes.com/video/insider/100000004687429/farewell-etaoin-shrdlu.html)
- [Binding Media: Print-Digital Literature 1980s-2010s](https://elikaortega.net/projects/1_project/)

## Week 2 - September 21: Do Artifacts Have Politics? + Text

What can things *do*? Considering the perspective of Science and Technology Studies. Are the technologies that we will study neutral? In other words, is the saying: “it depends how you use the tool that matters” universally true or is technology inherently biased?

Readings:
- [Winner, Langdon. "Do Artifacts Have Politics?" from *The Whale and the Reactor* (1986).](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~beki/cs4001/Winner.pdf)
- [Biss, Eula. "Time and Distance Overcome" from *Notes from No Man's Land* (2009).](https://pubs.lib.uiowa.edu/iowareview/article/16487/galley/124886/view/)

- Letter press demo
## Week 3 - September 28: Code + AI

What lies beneath the technologies we use everyday? Investigating the human and computer labor that fuels the web services we rely on. 

- [Hui, Yuk. ChatGPT, or the Eschatology of Machines](https://www.e-flux.com/journal/137/544816/chatgpt-or-the-eschatology-of-machines/)

- [Moderator Mayhem](https://moderatormayhem.engine.is/)
  
## Week 4 - October 5: Metadata / Data

Can data be neutral? What are the ethical considerations of collecting and analyzing data? 

Lisa Gitelman and Virginia Jackson write in the introduction for *"Raw Data" Is an Oxymoron*, 
>"Data need to be imagined as data to exist and function as such, and the imagination of data entails an interpretive base."

What do you think when you hear the term "raw data"?

## Week 5 - October 12: Network + Internet
![National ARPA Network Map](media/arpa-network.jpg)

Before we can go further into networked technologies, we ought to have a starting point - What do we mean when we say *internet*? What makes it different from other forms of information technology?

- [Visions for the Future Internet](https://findingctrl.nesta.org.uk/) A collection of essays, short stories, poetry and art work reflecting on the question of *what is the internet* and its history. As you browse the site focus on one section (Timeline, Enter, Power, Shift, Delete, ALT, Escape) that most interests you. Come prepared to share your thoughts and opinions

## Week 7 - November 2: Accessibility
Can we democratize knowledge? How can we make information more accessible for everyone?

- Guest speakers: Jessica Brangiel, Electronic Resources Librarian & Jenn Moore, Course Content Accessibility Manager

[![Bertin, Semiology of Graphics. 1983. p. 43.](media/bertin.png)](https://www.historyofinformation.com/detail.php?id=3361)

Can we move beyond pleasing images representing data to and understand that visualizations are a language in themselves? In other words, rather than just understanding visualizations as representations of data can we understand them as data?

In this process, what do we gain access to and, oppositely, what is effaced or made invisible?

## Week 8: Algorithms
The question of "What is an Algorithm?" is as important as the question of "What does an Algorithm do?"  There is a tension at play in what these authors are writing about and as you read and watch, pay attention to their answers to both questions. How would you answer?

## Week 10: Interlude 
How can we intervene or coopt the tools/discourse of commercial tech to approach pressing social and political problems? What limitations or problems might arise in doing so? This week we took a break from our regularly scheduled programming to collaborate on a mini design sprint, a tiny gesture towards electoral catharsis.

## Week 11: Machine Learning

Over the last twenty years give or take, the fabric of our lives has been interwoven with a special class of algorithms: Algorithms that use dynamic statistical weighting plus training data to generate novel outputs that may not have been explicitly programmed. Algorithms that, with more data and more iterations, self-modify. Spam filtering. Suggested text. Recommendations. Siri. Facial detection/recognition. Self-driving cars. This is not new!

In thinking about our last readings for the semester, take stock of the stack we've built so far during this semester: :turtle: artifacts **+** politics **+** HTML/CSS **+** internet infrastructure **+** clouds **+** data collection :turtle:

How might machine learning leverage the whole stack to ask pressing questions about not only our pasts but also possible futures?

  - Beyond the scope of this class but worth pointing to an emerging trend called Explainable AI of which this is one particularly entertaining example. What would it mean to ensure algorithms are intelligible by humans? To whom should this responsibility fall? -->
